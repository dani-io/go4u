# Go4u — Backend Architecture

## 1. Purpose
Define the **backend architecture and services** powering Go4u.  
Ensure scalability, security, and modularity for features like tasks, wallet, chat, contracts, and notifications.

---

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js 22 (ESM).  
- **Framework:** Next.js App Router (API routes for backend services).  
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict).  
- **ORM:** Prisma (PostgreSQL).  
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js + JWT.  
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis (jobs, rate limiting).  
- **Storage:** Cloud object storage (S3-compatible) for media/files.

## 3. Service Modules

### 3.1 User Service
- Signup / Login / Profile.  
- KYC integration (selfie ID verification).  
- Role management (Requester, Agent, Admin).  

### 3.2 Task Service
- Create, update, delete tasks.  
- Task lifecycle: Draft → Deal → Active → Done/Cancelled.  
- AI polish endpoint for task title/description.  
- Attachments (photos, docs).  

### 3.3 Chat Service
- Real-time chat (WebSocket or server-sent events).  
- AI-powered translation (optional).  
- Deal button triggers contract creation.

### 3.4 Contract & Certificate Service
- Generate contracts from task + chat history.  
- Multi-language support (English + profile language).  
- Volunteer certificate generation (PDF).  

### 3.5 Wallet & Payment Service
- Wallet balance management (Available, On Hold, Total).  
- Escrow logic (hold → release → refund).  
- Stripe/Adyen integration for deposits/withdrawals.  
- Audit logs for all transactions.

### 3.6 Notification Service
- Email (Postmark/Resend).  
- In-app notifications (bell + toast).  
- Push notifications (future, via FCM).  

### 3.7 Admin Service
- Manage users, tasks, payments.  
- Dispute resolution.  
- Analytics & growth metrics.

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Use Redis or Kafka (future) for pub/sub events.  
- Example events:  
  - `task.created`  
  - `task.deal.confirmed`  
  - `task.done`  
  - `payment.escrow.hold`  
  - `payment.released`  
  - `referral.qualified`  
- Services subscribe to relevant events (decoupled design).

---

## 5. Security
- JWT-based authentication.  
- RBAC (roles: requester, agent, admin).  
- Rate limiting & IP/device fingerprinting.  
- Secure storage of secrets (`ENVIRONMENT_VARS.md`).  
- Audit logs for critical actions (payment, contract, dispute).  

---

## 6. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling supported via stateless services.  
- Chat service can be split to dedicated WebSocket server.  
- Background workers handle heavy jobs (PDF generation, AI requests).  
- CDN for static files (media, certificates).  

---

## 7. Dev & Ops
- Local: Docker Compose for Postgres + Redis.  
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend + API), optional containerized microservices.  
- Monitoring: Sentry (errors), Prometheus/Grafana (metrics).  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint, test, deploy).  

---

## 8. Future Considerations
- Live session infra (TURN/STUN).  
- GraphQL API for external B2B integrations.  
- Multi-tenant support for enterprise clients.
